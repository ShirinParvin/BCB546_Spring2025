## Course Assignments

A description of files within this folder:

This folder is for the UNIX Assignemnt submission by Shirin Parvin.
* The two files `fang_et_al_genotypes.txt` and `snp_positions.txt` are data files that were used as source data for the assignment.
* The `transpose.awk` script was used to transpose the data.

The Markdown file UNIX_Assignment_Shirin.md contains explanation and code snippets used to solve the given Unix assignment. 
* The intermediate files generated for cleaning and processing the data are saved with file names that are self explanatory. More information about how these files were produced is in UNIX_Assignment_Shirin.md.
* The files generated as requested in the assignment are contained inside the folders maize_files and teosinte_files respectively.

Before the assignemnt was finalised, the processing files were also moved to maize_processing and teosinte_processing folders, respectively, to make the folder organization cleaner. Please note,the code is NOT changed to reflect this, for sake of clarity of processing and coding.
